Requirements

Responsive Alert: Make sure that each of your builds matches the responsiveness of the example!

1. Build the "Jumbotron" example.
2. Build the "Justified Nav" example.
3. Note that the actual styling of the navbar (the gradient, borders, etc) is defined in a non-bootstrap stylesheet. Don't worry about the visual appearance as long as they are side-by-side!

4. Build the "Carousel" example.
